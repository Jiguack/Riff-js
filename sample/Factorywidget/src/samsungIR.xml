					SEOUL, January 17, 2011 – Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd. today announced that Samsung Apps, the world’s first application store for the television, has reached its two millionth TV application download globally. The milestone is the latest in Samsung’s Smart TV category leadership, which was on full display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month. Samsung reached the 2 million mark within a year of the launch of Samsung Apps and the number of apps downloaded has doubled since November, when it reached one million downloads. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung Apps allows users to purchase and download applications from a wide variety of content and service providers, directly from their Smart TVs. Samsung Apps boasts around 380 applications designed for Smart TV, of which 259 are free. The store is currently available in 120 countries around the world.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“This achievement and the short period in which it was achieved demonstrate the rapidly growing popularity of applications and content for Smart TVs,” said Mr. Sangchul Lee, Senior Vice President of Samsung’s Visual Display Business. “Samsung’s leadership role in this category has paid off and allowed us to provide new experiences for consumers that are more rich and integrated than any before.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />Interest in applications on Smart TV increased at a tremendous pace during the holiday season. When Samsung Apps reached one million downloads in November, it had been just 268 days since the store’s launch. The two million-mark was reached just 53 days later.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />Some of the most frequently downloaded applications from Samsung Apps are YouTube, Hulu Plus, ESPN Next Level, AccuWeather, Google Maps and Texas Holdem, showcasing global demand for Samsung Smart TV entertainment experiences across popular consumer hobby areas – sports, movies and gaming. After reaching one million downloads, consumers have downloaded an average of 100,000 applications every five days. <br /><br /> <br /><br />To spur Smart TV innovation, Samsung is also working closely with the developer community to bring new applications to the Samsung Apps library. Throughout 2010, Samsung held “Free the TV Developer Days” around the world, bringing together developers and notable leaders across the connected TV ecosystem to discuss and plan for the next era of Smart TV. Accompanying the Developer Days were contests such as the “Free the TV Challenge” (http://www.freethetvchallenge.com/) in the United States, which announced its winners earlier this month at CES. <br /><br /> <br /><br />“The developer community is a critical component to maintaining the momentum and growth of Samsung Apps for the TV,” said Mr. Kyungshik Kevin Lee, Vice President of Samsung’s Visual Display Business. “These talented individuals will bring depth and personalization to an environment built initially with our industry-leading partners.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung announced a series of high-level partnerships during a keynote address by Visual Display Business President Boo-Keun Yoon, including alliances with cable television leaders Comcast and Time Warner as well as online video leaders Hulu and Adobe. <br /><br /> <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd<br /><br /><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion. Employing approximately 174,000 people in 193 offices across 66 countries, the company consists of eight independently operated business units: Visual Display, Mobile Communications, Telecommunication Systems, Digital Appliances, IT Solutions, Digital Imaging, Semiconductor and LCD.

					CES, Las Vegas – January 5, 2011 – Underscoring its position as a design leader, today Samsung unveiled its portfolio of 2011 consumer electronics highlighted by new smart TVs, consumer-inspired, easy-to-use cameras and camcorders, innovative IT products, and latest mobile technology for users at home and on the go at the company’s International Consumer Electronics Show press conference.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung’s product portfolio will be displayed January 6-9 at booth 12006 in the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center. Full details, video content and product images are available at the Samsung microsite at: www.samsungces2011.com. The press conference will also be streamed live from <br /><br />www.samsung.com, www.cnet.com/live and www.facebook.com/samsungtomorrow.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The backdrop of today’s announcements was Samsung’s concept of the “Smarter Life” and its three pillars: Smart Design, Smart Experiences, and Smart Connections. Smart design is “design with purpose” that enhances the function and user experience beyond the aesthetic. Smart Experiences involves the fastest content delivery of the widest variety of applications and games on the newest platforms and brightest screens, while Smart Connections enable devices to automatically connect with other devices to share content. Combined, the three pillars create a smarter life in which devices seamlessly connect to enable new content experiences.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung Takes Home Entertainment to the Very Edge<br /><br /> <br /><br />For 2011, Samsung has re-imagined the TV screen by making the bezel, which until now had traditionally framed the TV, virtually disappear. Samsung’s new ultra-narrow bezel design has influenced its flagship LED televisions for 2011 – the Samsung D8000 and D7000 LED TV Series. Both offer a bezel that is just 0.2 inches wide, providing more screen to enjoy than ever before. This means that people can put a larger screen into an area that previously could only fit a smaller one.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Samsung D6500 Plasma Series showcases Samsung’s breakthrough Plasma+1 design which features a new narrow bezel design so consumers get an extra inch of viewable screen size for a greater viewing area without increasing the outside dimensions of the set. This means that a traditional 58-inch plasma actually has 59-inches of veiwable screen size. <br /><br /> <br /><br />“In 2010 Samsung blurred the line between technology and art with the introduction of the LED 9000, which included a brushed metal design on the bezel and was Samsung’s slimmest LED TV ever at less than 0.3 inches thick,” said Sangchul Lee, Senior Vice President, Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. In 2011 Samsung is continuing to blend technology and art and taking TV design one step further, offering designs never seen before that blend seamlessly into the home.” <br /><br /> <br /><br />In addition to advanced design features, Samsung has also incorporated advanced smart TV features so people can get the most out of their entertainment experience. Samsung’s Smart Hub is a simple menu system that to connect, discover and enjoy a wide range of content. Users can easily search for movies, shows and videos via online services and across connected devices, browse the Web from your TV and access a wide variety of apps from Samsung Apps, the world’s first HDTV-based apps store. Almost all of Samsung‘s 2011 TVs that are 40-inches and above will offer smart TV features.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung also introduced several new TV innovations for 2011 including:<br /><br /> <br /><br />- Redesigning its 3-inch touch screen remote released in 2010. The Touch Control remote is now a full touch screen device that has the look and feel of a smartphone. The Touch Control’s multi display feature also lets users continue to watch TV on the screen even while a Blu-ray is being played on the TV<br /><br />- A line of accessories that include the world’s lightest and prescription-ready 3D glasses, Skype-certified HD camera for TV conferencing, wireless recharger and several wall mounts<br /><br /> <br /><br />Along with the unveiling of its newest TV innovations, Samsung also announced the latest in its lineup of Blu-ray players. Among them is the BD-6700, which boots up in 3 seconds and offers 2D-to-3D conversion as well as up-conversion of all content to full HD. In addition, Samsung unveiled the next-generation Blu-ray Home Theater Systems: the HT-C6730W, which features 3D Sound. 3D Sound synchs sound and video to create an immersive experience where the sound ‘moves’ with the 3D picture.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Digital Imaging: New Experience and ease of use with innovation<br /><br /> <br /><br />To help consumers stay easily connected to the world Samsung unveiled its newest digital camera and camcorder offerings. The SH100 allows photos to be posted straight to Facebook or YouTube in real time and can automatically back up photos on a PC. This is also the first camera that connects live to an Android smart phone, so it can use the phone to view the shot about to be taken in real time. A smartphone can also be used to view GPS information about where each photo was taken.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung also introduced its latest offering in its popular line of Dual-View cameras, the ST700. The Dual-view system was originally created in 2009 and it transformed the way self portraits were taken. With the new ST700, Samsung has built on its original Dual-View design adding its largest-ever front screen and features like Smart Filter 2.0, which gives a range of different photo effects. Both the SH100, ST700, and WB210 feature Samsung’s Interactive Smart Access User Interface, which allows for easy use of key features with simple touch recognition.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung introduced ultra slim, long zoom cameras, the WB210 and WB700.

					SEOUL, Korea, December 7, 2010 – Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., the world leader in advanced memory technology, today announced the development of an eight gigabyte (GB) registered dual inline memory module based on its advanced Green DDR3 DRAM. The new memory module, which has just been successfully tested by major Samsung customers, delivers superior performance, in particular because of its use of a three-dimensional (3D) chip stacking technology referred to as ‘through silicon via' (TSV).<br /><br /> <br /><br />“At Samsung, we’re well positioned to accommodate early market demand for our state-of-the-art TSV technology as the industry continues to forge forward with even further advances in bonding technology to enable greater performance and operational efficiency,“ said Dr. Chang-Hyun Kim, senior vice president and Samsung fellow, memory product planning & application engineering at Samsung Electronics. “Our 40nm-class* RDIMM being announced today marks the introduction of a more advanced eco-friendly “Green Memory” product line up utilizing 3D-TSV technology that is expected to enhance the leadership of Samsung and our allies in server and enterprise storage.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />An 8GB RDIMM utilizing Samsung’s 3D TSV technology saves up to 40 percent of the power consumed by a conventional RDIMM. Also, the TSV technology allows for a dramatic improvement in memory chip density that is expected to offset the decrease of memory sockets in next generation server systems. In the face of a 30 percent decrease in memory slots in next-generation servers, the TSV technology will be able to raise the DRAM density by more than 50 percent, making it highly attractive for high-density, high-performance server systems.<br /><br /> <br /><br />          Samsung’s TSV technology is a key to solving the paradox of driving lower power consumption in servers, while increasing memory capacity and improving performance. <br /><br /> <br /><br />The TSV technology fabricates micron-sized holes through the silicon vertically, with a copper filling. By using the ‘through silicon via’ bonding process instead of conventional wire bonding, signal lines are shortened significantly, enabling the multi-stacked chip to function at levels comparable to a single silicon chip. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Already passing customer performance tests, Samsung is readying its TSV technology for a variety of server applications having stringent performance and power demands.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Increasingly widespread adoption of the 3D TSV technology is expected to take place from 2012. Samsung plans to apply the higher performance and lower power features of its TSV technology to 30nm-class* and finer process nodes.<br /><br /> <br /><br />For more information about Samsung Green DDR3, visit www.samsung.com/GreenMemory<br /><br /> <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion.

					SEOUL, Korea – December 2, 2010 – Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, a global leader in advanced semiconductor technology solutions, announced today that it has developed and started sampling the industry’s first monolithic four gigabit (Gb), low power double-data-rate 2 (LPDDR2) DRAM using 30 nanometer (nm) class* technology in November. The chip will be used in high-end mobile applications such as smartphones and tablet PCs.<br /><br /> “The mobile device market is gaining momentum with the advent of tablet PCs, which is adding significantly to the already surging smartphone segment,” said Jun-Young Jeon, vice president, memory product planning team, Samsung Electronics. “Samsung will work closely with mobile device designers to bring high-performance, high-density mobile solutions to market as rapidly as possible.”<br /><br />The new 4Gb LPDDR2 DRAM can transfer up to 1,066 megabits per second (Mbps), which approaches the performance of memory solutions for PC applications. It more than doubles the performance of the industry's previous mobile DRAM — MDDR, which operates between 333Mbps and 400Mbps.<br /><br />To accommodate continually diversifying consumer needs for mobile application features, advanced memory chips offering both high performance and high density are becoming essential. <br /><br />Starting this month, Samsung will begin sampling 8Gb LPDDR2 DRAM by stacking two 4Gb chips in a single package, as it is expected that 8Gb will become the mainstream density for the mobile DRAM market next year.<br /><br />Until now, an 8Gb (1GB) LPDDR2 DRAM used four 2Gb chips. With the new Green 4Gb LPDDR2, the 8Gb solution offers a 20 percent package height reduction (0.8mm vs. 1.0mm) and will save 25 percent of the power consumed by the previous 8Gb package that used four 2Gb chips. This enables thinner, lighter mobile devices with longer battery life.<br /><br />Samsung developed a 2Gb LPDDR2 DRAM chip based on 40nm-class technology in February of this year and has been providing that solution since April to cope with the rising demand for advanced mobile DRAMs. With the new 30nm-class 4Gb chip, Samsung will meet the sharply increasing needs for high-density LPDDR2 solutions, as the smartphone and tablet PC markets expand throughout 2011. It also plans to provide 16Gb (2GB) LPDDR2 DRAM by stacking four of the 4Gb chips, as capacity needs continue to grow.<br /><br />According to iSuppli, shipments of mid to high-end smartphones will increase at about an 18 percent annual rate from 2009 to 2014. This signals dramatic expansion of the mobile DRAM market overall, which may register as much as 64 percent growth in mobile DRAM use during the same period, iSuppli also reported..<br /><br />For more information about Samsung Green memory, visit www.samsung.com/GreenMemory<br /><br /> <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion.

					SEOUL, Korea – November 9, 2010 – Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd has announced the release of the music video for indie band OK Go’s latest song “Last Leaf.”  The video was filmed using Samsung’s new NX100 camera, the perfect tool to take great, creative images and film anywhere, anytime, and is available to view today at www.cre8yourworld.com.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The “Last Leaf” video was made using thousands of photographs taken with the Samsung NX100, woven together to create a stop motion animation clip, showing the technical capabilities and creative versatility of the NX100. The images were combined with hand-drawn animations by the band themselves along with award-winning animator Geoff McFettridge to create a unique music video. The collaboration marks a new artistic direction for OK Go, whose previous videos have been composed of one-take live-action clips. <br /><br /> <br /><br />The partnership between OK Go and Samsung has been documented in a behind-the-scenes series, also filmed on the NX100, which can be seen at www.cre8yourworld.com. The documentary follows OK Go and their collaborators as they go through each stage of creating the video. The final clip in the series, which goes live on November 9, 2010, will show how OK Go achieved their creative vision using the NX100. <br /><br /> <br /><br />OK Go are recognized the world over for their groundbreaking and inventive music videos, which have received more than 125 million views online. Videos include “Here it Goes Again” (also known as “Treadmills Dance”), which features the band performing a choreographed routine across eight treadmills in one continuous take. The band’s latest video and single, “White Knuckles,” achieved a million YouTube hits in 24 hours when it was released in October 2010. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Damian Kulash, lead singer of OK Go, said of the partnership: “Samsung’s been great because we had a creative idea and they had the tools to help us make it.” <br /><br /> <br /><br />Mr. SangJin Park, President of the Digital Imaging Business, Samsung Electronics, said of the completed video: “We are impressed and inspired by the band’s memorable and imaginative music videos. The NX100, as an easy-to-use but high-quality camera, was the perfect tool to let the band express their creativity and experiment with new ideas. The camera is small enough to fit around your life but powerful enough to realize your creative ideas through great pictures. The ‘Last Leaf’ music video is a perfect example of how the NX100 enables you to bring your inspiration to life.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Samsung NX100 was designed to make taking beautiful pictures simple, quick and easy and was the ideal camera to capture OK Go’s innovative music video. This was achieved with the help of the 20mm ‘active’ i-Function lens, which allows users to control the camera’s settings via the lens itself, without having to take the camera off target. This intuitive lens has proven so popular that Samsung decided to include the i-Function technology in all of their future lenses for the NX range, including five additional lenses that will be introduced next year. It also provided a new firmware updates making the i-Function lens compatible with the NX10 and NX5. <br /><br /> <br /><br />The NX100 boasts the compact size and lightweight advantages of being a mirrorless camera, while delivering the image quality of a DSLR. Available in four different colors, the design of the NX100, inspired by the shape of a dewdrop forming on a leaf, is also sleek and stylish. The camera features the fastest Auto Focus (AF) of any interchangeable lens camera to date, making it even easier to have the perfect picture at your fingertips. <br /><br /> <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd<br /><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion. Employing approximately 188,000 people in 185 offices across 65 countries, the company consists of eight independently operated business units: Visual Display, Mobile Communications, Telecommunication Systems, Digital Appliances, IT Solutions, Digital Imaging, Semiconductor and LCD.

For more information, please visit www.samsung.com.<br /><br /> <br /><br />About OK Go<br /><br />OK Go, the most downloaded band ever, will be creating a video for every song on their critically acclaimed release, “Of The Blue Colour of the Sky.” The album has garnered much praise with a four-star review in People Magazine, and Alternative Press saying “it fills you with hope for the next decade’s musical offerings.” OK Go’s videos have won numerous awards, including a Grammy for “Here It Goes Again” and several wins at film festivals this year for the Rube Goldberg Machine video they created for their first single, “This Too Shall Pass.” OK Go is constantly pushing boundaries both musically and as viral video creators.

			<title>IR News : Samsung Electronics Announces Third Quarter 2010 Results</title> 
			<link>http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/news/newsIrRead.do?news_ctgry=irnewsrelease=19748</link> 
			<description>			
				
				<![CDATA[
					SEOUL, Korea – October 29, 2010 – Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced revenues of 40.23 trillion Korean won on a consolidated basis for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2010, a 12-percent increase year-on-year. The figure tops the previous record for quarterly revenue of 39.25 trillion won recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009.<br /><br /> <br /><br />For the quarter, the company posted record consolidated net income of 4.46 trillion won, a 17-percent increase year-on-year. Consolidated operating profit for the quarter was 4.86 trillion won.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Provisions for various patent-related expenses totaling 230 billion won were reflected to third quarter earnings. Without these provisions, operating profit would have been close to 5.1 trillion won.<br /><br /> <br /><br />In its earnings guidance disclosed on October 7, Samsung estimated third-quarter consolidated revenues would reach approximately 40 trillion won with an operating profit of 4.8 trillion won.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The company’s increased profitability in the third quarter was driven by the strong performance of its Semiconductor Business, which recorded an operating profit of 3.42 trillion won.  The Mobile Communications Business also achieved solid growth with profit supported by increased sales of flagship smartphones such as the Galaxy S.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“In the third quarter, Samsung faced a challenging business environment including declining demand for PCs and TVs, along with a continued economic slowdown in developed markets such as US and Europe,” said Robert Yi, Vice President and head of Samsung Electronics’ Investor Relations Team. “Despite this, we achieved strong revenue growth and profitability, which was built upon our cost competitiveness in memory semiconductors and increased sales of cutting-edge products such as our latest smartphones.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, year-end demand for TVs and mobile handsets will support continued sales growth.  However, Samsung expects oversupply in the memory semiconductor market will lead to reduced pricing, while prices for LCD panel will continue to decline. The recent appreciation of the Korean won is also expected to put downward pressure on fourth quarter earnings.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung also announced that total capital expenditures for the year through September 30 reached 15 trillion won, representing 83 percent of the total planned outlay of 18.2 trillion won for 2010. When including investment in subsidiaries such as Samsung Mobile Display, consolidated capex will reach 20 trillion won for the year.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Semiconductor Business Records Highest Ever Quarterly Earnings<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung’s Semiconductor Business achieved record consolidated sales of 10.66 trillion won in the third quarter, with an operating profit of 3.42 trillion won, representing a profit margin of 32.1 percent.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Memory Division accounted for 7.49 trillion won in revenue, a 60-percent increase year-on-year. In DRAM, cost competitiveness and strategic investments allowed Samsung to outperform the market, amid a decline in prices due to market oversupply.  For NAND, strong demand for embedded products, especially for smartphones and tablet PCs, led to increased profitability.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The System LSI Division also achieved a significant improvement in both revenue and profit, driven by strong demand for mobile application processors and CMOS Image Sensors.<br /><br /> <br /><br />For the fourth quarter, Samsung forecast continued oversupply in DRAM and weak PC demand will weigh on the market, while in NAND embedded product demand is expected to have a positive effect on profitability.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />LCD Business Slow Over Weak Demand <br /><br /> <br /><br />The LCD Business recorded an operating profit of 520 billion won on revenue of 8.10 trillion won. The operating profit margin declined to 6.5 percent due to a slump in demand, particularly in the United States and Europe.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Across the industry, large-size panel shipments fell quarter-on-quarter to 160 million units from 167 million, including both TV and IT panels.  Average sales prices for notebook PC, monitor and TV panels all witnessed declines. <br /><br /> <br /><br />For Samsung, total shipments increased slightly year-on-year and remained flat compared with the previous quarter.  Performance was driven by sales of premium products including LED TVs panels due to year-end demand in developed markets. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Demand for TV and monitor panels is expected to remain weak in the fourth quarter, although demand will pick up for notebook panels stimulated by growing tablet PC sales.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung plans to focus on highly profitable premium products such as LED TV and 3D TV panels, and optimize product lines to respond to the market environment.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung Mobile Handset Sales Up 12 Percent <br /><br /> <br /><br />The telecommunication businesses – including Mobile Communications and Telecommunication Networks – posted an operating profit of 1.13 trillion won on revenue of 11.12 trillion won. The operating profit margin was 10.2 percent. <br /><br /> <br /><br />In the Mobile Communications Business, Samsung sold 71.4 million handsets during the third quarter, an increase of 19 percent year-on-year, outperforming the industry. Average sales price also increased 14 percent quarter-on-quarter. The rollout of Samsung’s flagship smartphones, Galaxy S and Wave, were the primary drivers of continued sales growth amid a global demand recovery. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Since its introduction in June, Galaxy S has been launched in 90 countries and has been selected by 210 carriers worldwide. Samsung projects sales of 10 million units by the end of 2010. The Samsung Wave, which operates on Samsung’s open smartphone platform, bada, has also shipped more than two million units in 80 countries. <br /><br /> <br /><br />The quarter was also marked by the launch of Samsung’s Android-powered Galaxy Tab, which will be available on 140 carriers globally including all four major service providers in the United States. <br /><br /> <br /><br />In the fourth quarter, Samsung aims to increase its market share and maintain double-digit operating profit by meeting seasonal demand with an enhanced product mix of mass market smartphones, full-touch phones and the Galaxy Tab.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Slow Economic Recovery Impacts Digital Media Businesses <br /><br /> <br /><br />Due to an increase in sales of TV and digital appliance products, Samsung’s digital media businesses achieved 14.13 trillion won in revenue in the third quarter, a 10 percent increase year-on-year but a three percent decrease quarter-on-quarter.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The businesses – which include Visual Display, IT Solutions, Digital Appliances and Digital Imaging –<br /><br />recorded an operating loss of 230 billion won. This was attributed to reduced profitability in TVs and a loss for Digital Appliance products. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Flat panel TV shipments in the third quarter reached 9.07 million units, a 17-percent jump year-on-year. Sales of premium TVs such as LED and 3D-capable models decreased following the 2010 World Cup, due to weakening consumer confidence amid the slow economic recovery in the United States and Europe.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung anticipates that the seasonal peak in the fourth quarter for TV sales will help sustain the growth trend in both developed and emerging markets. However, severe price competition is also expected. Samsung aims to grow the Smart TV market by providing local market-specific content and developing its reputation as a pioneer, just as the company has done in the LED TV and 3D TV markets.<br /><br /> <br /><br />In the Digital Appliance Business, Samsung achieved growth of 25 percent quarter-on-quarter, but increased costs and investments in production and sales infrastructure pushed the business into a deficit.<br /><br />Samsung will continue to expand its distribution channels and global production sites while developing highly efficient and environmentally friendly products. <br /><br /><br />About Samsung Electronics<br /><br /><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion. Employing approximately 188,000 people in 185 offices across 65 countries, the company consists of eight independently operated business units: Visual Display, Mobile Communications, Telecommunication Systems, Digital Appliances, IT Solutions, Digital Imaging, Semiconductor and LCD.

					Chicago, October 19, 2010 – Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., a leading provider of advanced mobile technology, demonstrates it’s commitment to support the era of real mobile broadband with 4G network solutions at 4G World 2010 in Chicago. <br /><br />At the conference, Samsung is showcasing the excellence and time-to-market advantages of its 4G mobile products through demonstrations with WiMAX 2 based on IEEE 802.16m and LTE. Samsung is demoing Full-HD 3D video streaming and 16 Full-HD videos streaming on four TVs simultaneously. The technology is powered by Samsung’s WiMAX 2 trial systems and devices and has peak data throughput of 330Mbps. <br /><br />With the popularity of smart phones and introduction of tablet PCs, mobile data traffic is exponentially increasing. In particular, since the amount of mobile data used by smart phones is about 30 times more than the data used by feature phones and tablet PCs use 10 times more data than smart phones, handling a huge amount of mobile data traffic is becoming more significant for both service operators and solution providers. <br /><br />Samsung understands these challenges and has developed a complete 4G solution from high to low capacity and from dense urban to rural and in-building. With Samsung’s broad range of solutions, including macro, pico, and femto, operators can provide high-quality as well as stable data and voice services. Samsung offers a wide choice for service operators, and solutions are based on both Mobile WiMAX and LTE (Long Term Evolution). <br /><br />Through WiMAX 2 solutions with speeds of 330Mbps, subscribers can download a full-length movie (1.5 GB) in 36 seconds and a set of Britannica dictionaries (4 GB) in 97 seconds. These download speeds are more than 20 times faster than current 3G services. <br /><br />Samsung is also exhibiting its latest LTE technology, a complete solution that includes infrastructure equipment and devices. In partnership with MetroPCS in Las Vegas last month, Samsung introduced the first commercial LTE systems and handset in the U.S. The technology, on display at 4G World, uses Samsung’s LTE macro base station, USB dongle and netbook. <br /><br />Both Mobile WiMAX and LTE have similar technological backbones, including Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), Smart Antenna, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) and more. Samsung has proven its leadership in Mobile WiMAX technology and has over 25% of the essential LTE patents for OFDMA as well as a long history of involvement in the third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and LSTI (LTE/SAE Trial Initiative). WiMAX 2 on IEEE 802.16m and LTE received ITU approval as the IMT-Advance (4G) standards last week. <br /><br />Mr. Woonsub Kim, Executive Vice President and Head of the Telecommunication Systems Business of Samsung Electronics, said, “We’re thrilled to introduce our latest WiMAX and LTE solutions to the U.S. market. As service operators prepare to launch next-generation mobile broadband to meet the growing need for data from mobile Internet users, Samsung is reinforcing its commitment to introducing 4G wireless technologies while continuing to improve on existing 3G performance.” “Samsung will continue to drive the effort to break down boundaries between mobile and fixed broadband,” he added.<br /><br />WiMAX 2 standards are expected to be finalized by November 2010 and the WiMAX Forum is preparing to release certified products of WiMAX 2 by the fourth quarter of 2011. Samsung aims to launch its first commercial solutions of WiMAX 2 in 2012 through UQ Communications in Japan. <br /><br />Visit Samsung Electronics at booth #501 at 4G World.<br /><br /> <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics<br /><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion.

					October 6h, 2010, SEOUL, Korea – Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., a leading mobile phone provider, today announced the launch of the Samsung Wave II (Model : GT-S8530). The Wave II is based on bada 1.2, the latest edition of Samsung’s own open smartphone platform. Complete with extensive multimedia entertainment, integrated messaging and an enhanced user experience, the all new Samsung Wave II delivers a powerful mix of upgraded smart performance.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Samsung Wave II has been designed to enable superior user-experience - a large 3.7” enhanced TFT-LCD screen gives a stunning viewing experience so users can enjoy truly vibrant and expressive multimedia. By supporting multiple video formats the phone provides universal compatibility for easy viewing of different movie file types while support for HD video recording lets users capture life unfolding with crystal-clarity on the superior display. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung Wave II also comes with Social Hub which lets users view their phonebook, SNS, IM and email together in an integrated one-page layout, keeping them constantly connected. For unlimited personalization, Samsung Wave II supports the Samsung Apps to deliver a world of interesting, compelling and entertaining applications and services. Upgraded features like QuickType by t9 Trace offers a faster and easier way to input text than standard texting - rather than punching in individual numbers, users just trace a finger in a continuous motion over the letters of a word and the device intelligently determines which word is being spelled.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“The Samsung Wave II shows that Samsung never rests when it comes to delivering a truly innovative smartphone experience. Samsung’s success with the first Samsung Wave smartphone did not slow our drive to further integrate social media, rich multimedia and enhanced features,” said JK Shin, President and Head of Mobile Communications Business at Samsung Electronics. “Our customers told us that they would like to have a bigger display and a better input method so we fulfilled their needs. They said they like advanced features so we built more into the device. The Samsung Wave II has really shown Samsung’s innovative capabilities,” he said.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The stunning full-touch smartphone will be available starting in November 2010 in France and will be gradually rolled out to other global markets including Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East Asia, Africa, India and China.

One of the clearest indications of this leadership is Samsung’s leadership in 3D TVs, where projected sales of over 2 million units worldwide has raised the bar in the industry. <br /><br />Yoon also detailed Samsung’s continued strides in environmental management, noting how the company’s PlanetFirst initiative invested more than $865 million in 2009, putting Samsung on track to meet its goal of being one of the world’s most environmentally friendly companies by 2013. <br /><br /><br />A Galaxy of Possibilities <br /><br />Samsung introduced the GALAXY Tab, the company’s first “smart media device.” Powered by Android™ 2.2, GALAXY Tab brings a unique mobile experience allowing more possibilities on the go. The 7inch display offers an optimal media environment to enjoy reading books or newspapers, full web browsing, watching videos, and listening to music. Moreover, users can continuously communicate via e-mail, voice and video call, SMS/MMS or social network with the optimized user interface. <br /><br />To provide abundant content to its users, Samsung GALAXY Tab comes with the ‘Readers Hub,’ Samsung’s unique e-reading application that provides easy access to a vast digital library. At the same time, Samsung unveils ‘Media Hub,’ a gateway to a world of films and videos, and ‘Music Hub,’ an application giving access to a wide range of music tunes. With GALAXY Tab, users have new powers to consume, create, and communicate from wherever they are. <br /><br />For more information on GALAXY Tab, please visit http://galaxytab.samsungmobile.com/press <br /><br /><br />3D Expansion & Arrival of Smart TV <br /><br />Building on the success of its 3D launches earlier this year and subsequent market leadership, Samsung announced it will launch seven more 3D TV models during the second half of 2010 to expand its 3D total solution line-up in the European market. This expansion brings its total to an industry-leading 25 models, Included among these is a 50-inch Full HD 3D Plasma. Samsung is the only company which received the official ECO Flower certification from the European Union with plasma full line-up, excluding large sizes. <br /><br />Joining these TVs will be six new 3D Blu-ray systems, including the C8900 Blu-ray player. The C8900 is the first 3D Blu-ray to combine recording and storing functionalities on a 500GB HDD with the ability to record and play back the HD and 3D broadcasting without losing Samsung’s unsurpassed picture quality. <br /><br />Michael Zoeller, European Marketing Director for Television and Audio Visual Products, explained to the audience that while Samsung’s 3D leadership will continue to expand, it is also a part of a larger emerging trend – Smart TV. Zoeller displayed Samsung’s premium Smart 3D TV, the C9000, and discussed the growth of Samsung Apps for TV since its launch in January. <br /><br />That growth is the basis for Samsung’s consecutive announcements of apps contests in Europe, Korea and United States. Samsung announced the Samsung Smart TV Challenge at IFA and more than 500,000 Euros will be awarded to developers across Europe for the best apps designed for Samsung TVs. To help developers understand Samsung’s Smart TV, the Samsung Apps platform and the SDK (Software Development Kit) for the contest, European Developer Days will be hosted in Germany, France, and the UK in October, and final winners will be announced in February 2011. <br /><br />More information on Samsung Smart TV Challenge is available at www.SamsungSmartTVChallenge.eu <br /><br /><br />Image Leadership & IT on the Go <br /><br />Samsung continues to launch an array of new digital imaging products and strengthen its standing in the marketplace. Building on the success of its revolutionary dual-view camera launched in 2009, Samsung unveiled two new dual view cameras, ST600/100 at IFA 2010. Samsung also introduced a number of digital imaging products to provide consumers with a better user experience, such as the T10 camcorder that features a unique slanted lens that allows for less pressure on the wrist. These products are designed to be mobile, comfortable and ensure that users can always capture and share life’s special moments. <br /><br />In the IT space, Samsung responded to consumer demand for mobility and performance from their computers by launching the Samsung SF and RF series.

					SEOUL, Korea – July 30, 2010 – Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced revenues of 37.89 trillion Korean won on a consolidated basis for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010, a 17 percent increase year-on-year. For the quarter, the company posted net income of 4.28 trillion won. <br /><br />Consolidated operating profit for the quarter was a record 5.01 trillion won, an 88 percent increase year-on-year. The figure tops the previous high of 4.41 trillion won in the first quarter of 2010. <br /><br />In its earnings guidance disclosed on July 7, Samsung estimated second-quarter consolidated revenues would reach approximately 37 trillion won with an operating profit of 5 trillion won. <br /><br />The company’s increased profitability in the second quarter was driven by significant improvements in its components businesses. The Semiconductor Business recorded an operating profit of 2.94 trillion won on sales of 9.53 trillion won, while the LCD Business generated an operating profit of 880 billion won on 7.76 trillion won in sales. Samsung’s set businesses – spanning digital media, IT solutions and telecommunications – also performed well despite increased price competition and uncertain global consumer sentiment. <br /><br />“In the second quarter, our component businesses performed very strongly, yet it was a more challenging quarter for our set businesses,” said Robert Yi, Vice President and head of Samsung Electronics’ Investor Relations Team. "With intensified competition throughout the digital media and mobile industries going forward, it may become a challenge to maintain current profitability levels. However, we will continue to focus on introducing differentiated products and widening our technology leadership in components to meet these difficult market conditions.” <br /><br />Strong seasonal demand for core components will drive Samsung’s performance in the third quarter, although increased market supply is also forecast. Samsung forecasts that continued price competition in its set businesses will put downward pressure on profit margins in the third quarter. <br /><br />Samsung also announced that total capital expenditures for the first half of 2010 reached 9.2 trillion won, representing 51 percent of the total of 18.2 trillion won in capex planned for 2010. <br /><br /><br />Semiconductor Business Records 30.8 Percent Profit Margin <br /><br />Samsung’s Semiconductor Business recorded consolidated sales of 9.53 trillion won with an operating profit of 2.94 trillion won in the first quarter, representing a profit margin of 30.8 percent. Reflecting the market recovery, operating profit was up 765 percent on the 340 billion won recorded a year ago. <br /><br />The Memory Division continued to drive growth, accounting for 6.71 trillion won of sales, an increase of 74 percent year-on-year. Strong demand in the DRAM market was driven by a mid 20-percent increase in PC shipments and more than 30-percent rise in gigabytes per system year-on-year. In NAND, despite weak seasonality, demand remained steady due to strong sales of mobile devices including smartphones and tablet PCs. Samsung’s enhanced profitability was supported by accelerating the migration to 40-nm-class process technology in the DRAM market and expanding 30-nm-class process in NAND. <br /><br />In the third quarter, the demand for DRAM is expected to rise due to strong seasonality, while there will also be increased demand for high-capacity NAND products. Samsung will focus on widening its technological leadership by expanding 30- and 40-nm-class memory products and enhancing price competitiveness. <br /><br /><br />LCD Market Growth Strong <br /><br />The LCD Business recorded an operating profit of 880 billion won on revenue of 7.76 trillion won. The operating profit margin was 11.3 percent, compared with 4.2 percent the previous year. <br /><br />Amid strong market demand, Samsung’s LCD panel sales increased 15-20 percent year-on-year. The industry average sales price for TV panels increased three percent, while notebook PC and monitor panel pricing was flat. <br /><br />Samsung focused on increasing sales of premium LCD panels for LED and 3D TVs, while enhancing its manufacturing line efficiency in order to improve profit margins. <br /><br />The company expects strong seasonal demand in the third quarter, but increased supply in the market will have a balancing effect. <br /><br /><br />Samsung Mobile Handset Sales Up 22 Percent <br /><br />The telecommunication businesses – including Mobile Communications and Telecommunication Networks – posted an operating profit of 630 billion won on revenue of 8.78 trillion won. The operating profit margin was 7.2 percent. <br /><br />In the Mobile Communications Business, Samsung sold 63.8 million handsets during the second quarter, an increase of 22 percent year-on-year. However, increased market competition caused a slight decline in average sales price. Touch-screen mobile handsets made up 30 percent of Samsung’s unit sales during the quarter, compared with 15 percent a year ago, as Samsung continued to increase its leadership in the segment. <br /><br />In the third quarter, Samsung aims to increase its share of the growing smartphone market through flagship devices including the Galaxy S and Wave. The Android-powered Galaxy S has been selected by more than 100 carriers around the world, including four major service providers in the United States. Samsung will also launch a range of mid-end smartphones as part of its strategy to provide mobile devices for every lifestyle. <br /><br /><br />Samsung Takes Lead in 3D TV with Sales of 500,000 Units <br /><br />Samsung’s digital media businesses – including Visual Display and Digital Appliances – registered sales of 14.54 trillion won, a 20 percent increase year-on-year. Operating profit was 360 billion won, down from 1.16 trillion won in the same period last year. <br /><br />In flat panel TVs, Samsung shipped 9.02 million units, up 43 percent year-on-year due to strong growth in developing markets. In developed markets, increased sales of large-sized, LED and 3D-capable TVs drove operating profit. Samsung took a strong lead in the 3D TV market, selling more than 500,000 units following the launch of its new lineup in March. <br /><br />Digital Appliance sales rose 23 percent from the same period of 2009, supported by demand in developed markets, Russia and some emerging markets. <br />In the third quarter, demand for flat panel TVs is forecast to increase 20 percent year-on-year. Sales of high-end LED models are expected to rise, accounting for 30 percent of total LCD TV sales during the fourth quarter. Samsung will continue to expand its LED TV lineup and reinforce leadership with its 3D total solution. <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. <br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion.

				<![CDATA[
					Seoul, Korea and Tokyo, Japan, July 22, 2010 – Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation (TOKYO: 6502) today announced their commitment to development of the most advanced high-performance NAND flash memory technology available today – a double data rate (DDR) NAND flash memory with a 400 megabit-per-second (Mbps) interface, toggle DDR 2.0 specification. The high-performance NAND memory is expected to be of immediate benefit to a host of NAND-based mobile and consumer electronics applications, especially where there is consumer demand for an extra stretch in performance. Both companies will support a standard industry specification to enable broad-scale acceptance of this new high-speed technology. <br /><br />“Our introduction of high-speed 30 nanometer class NAND late last year served as an initial pathway for stimulating acceptance of the new high-performance toggle DDR technology,” said Dong-Soo Jun, executive vice president, memory marketing, Samsung Electronics. “Now, continual upgrades in high-speed performance will create new applications and broader market opportunities for NAND flash memory. The rapid adoption of fourth generation (4G) smartphones, tablet PCs and solid state drives is expected to drive demand for a broader range of high-performance NAND solutions.” <br /><br />“Toggle DDR provides a faster interface than conventional NAND using an asynchronous design, delivering the benefits of high-speed data transfer to a wider market, such as for solid state drive (SSD) applications including enterprise storage, mobile phones, multimedia terminals and consumer products,” said Masaki Momodomi, Technical Executive, Memory product, Toshiba Corporation. “And we will continue to make the best effort possible to create standard, high-speed NAND Flash interface solutions with NAND vendors and customers, which will accelerate the revolution in storage applications.” <br /><br />The current toggle DDR 1.0 specification applies a DDR interface to conventional single data rate (SDR) NAND architecture. The resulting NAND chip has a 133Mbps interface. <br /><br />Samsung and Toshiba will focus on assuring a 400Mbps interface for the toggle DDR 2.0 specification, which provides a three-fold increase over toggle DDR 1.0, and a ten-fold increase over 40Mbps SDR NAND in widespread use today. <br /><br />Both companies support industry-wide adoption of the high-speed specification, which would facilitate faster acceptance of toggle DDR memory with hardware engineers and application designers. Last month, each company started participating in standardization efforts for the new technology through the JEDEC Solid State Technology Association. <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. <br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion. Employing approximately 188,000 people in 185 offices across 65 countries, the company consists of eight independently operated business units: Visual Display, Mobile Communications, Telecommunication Systems, Digital Appliances, IT Solutions, Digital Imaging, Semiconductor and LCD. Recognized as one of the fastest growing global brands, Samsung Electronics is a leading producer of digital TVs, memory chips, mobile phones and TFT-LCDs.

					SEOUL, Korea – July 6, 2010 – Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., the number one worldwide brand for display products, is continuing to evolve LED monitor technology by offering environmentally-friendly monitors with better viewing angles and eye-catching designs with the release of its 50 and 30 series LED monitors. <br /><br />Before developing its latest LED monitors, Samsung consumers identified three key areas that would benefit consumer needs – eco-friendliness, design and viewing experience. Samsung addressed these mandates in the following ways: <br /><br />- Eco-friendly LED backlight: The 50 and 30 series LED monitors highlight Samsung’s commitment to putting the PlanetFirst™. Unlike conventional monitors, LED-backlit displays contain few or no environmentally hazardous substances, such as mercury or lead, and use about 40 percent less energy. Samsung’s Touch of Color (ToC) technology doesn’t use paints, sprays or glues, ensuring they contain no Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), making recycling simpler and safer. <br /><br />Samsung’s Magic Eco feature allows users to adjust a monitor’s brightness based on different energy consumption levels with four preset energy-saving options to choose from: 100 percent, 75 percent, 50 percent, and Power-Saving Off. Additionally, the 50 and 30 series monitors meet international energy standards including Energy Star 5.0 and China’s Energy Level 1 grade (50 series), proving themselves eco-friendly products. <br /><br />- Sleek and slim design: Both the 50 and 30 series introducenew, sleek designs that set them apart from previous design trends. Both have adopted Samsung’s trademark ToC technology, reducing monitor thickness dramatically. The 50 series employs a Charcoal gray ToC design, a stand with a chrome finish and a delicate wave back-pattern. The 30 series differentiates itself with its Mystic Brown ToC design, a color not commonly found in conventional monitors, which is reminiscent of rich, handcrafted chocolate. These products truly deliver on Samsung’s design philosophy that consumer electronics should resemble pieces of art that help tie a room together. <br /><br />- The most comfortable viewing experience: Samsung’s new 50 and 30 series LED monitors support Samsung’s proprietary Magic Angle feature to reduce eye strain and ensure that images are centered when viewed from any angle. This eliminates distortion and provides the best viewing angle whether standing, sitting, or even lying down. Consumers can also enjoy vivid, dynamic images thanks to the Mega Dynamic Contrast Ratio, ultra-fast response time of 2ms, FHD resolution, and a 16:9 aspect ratio. <br /><br />Also unique to the 50 series is a new feature called Magic Return. When users are working with two monitors, Magic Return automatically moves content from a screen that is abruptly turned off to the screen that is still on, enabling content to be accessed even if one of the monitors gets disconnected, or shuts off. <br /><br />“Samsung’s 50 and 30 LED monitors illustrate our commitment to releasing top-of-the-line products that are environmentally-friendly and address the needs of consumers,” said Jin-hwan Kim, Vice President, Visual Display Business, Samsung Electronics. “Through our continuous monitor innovations, we expect the 50 and 30 series of LED monitors will strengthen our leadership in the global LED monitor market.” <br /><br /><br />About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. <br /><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion. Employing approximately 188,000 people in 185 offices across 65 countries, the company consists of eight independently operated business units: Visual Display, Mobile Communications, Telecommunication Systems, Digital Appliances, IT Solutions, Digital Imaging, Semiconductor and LCD.

					SEOUL, Korea – June 25, 2010 –Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., today announced the launch and availability of the world’s first RGB LED data projector with 1,000 ANSI lumens. With no lamp to replace, the SP-F10M has an LED light source that promises a lifespan of 50,000 hours using Eco-mode, and significantly reduces the hassle, environmental impact, and total cost of ownership. The LED light source also maintains its brightness over the most of life of the projector, with greater color intensity and range than any LED projector currently available. <br /><br />Conventional projectors need to have their lamps replaced after 3,000 hours of use, but the SP-F10M has an LED light that lasts 50,000 hours in Eco-mode, giving it a 17 time longer lifespan than conventional projectors. The greater color intensity and wide color gamut allows for a more flexible projector, which can be used on a blackboard or green board, in addition to white boards and screens, thereby opening it up to the education, government and corporate marketplaces. <br /><br />Eliminating the conventional halogen bulb, which contains mercury filaments, dramatically reduces the negative environmental effects associated with their disposal. These disposal costs also contribute to the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a projector during its lifetime. <br /><br />The reduced decibel level and power consumption and power-up time provided by the LED light source also add to the appeal of the SP-F10M <br /><br />“At Samsung, we pride ourselves on creating cutting edge products that are environmentally friendly, make user’s lives easier and reduce TCO,” said JinHwan Kim, Vice President of Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. “The SP-F10M is another great example of our product innovation in the projector market, offering considerable brightness and a color intensity advantage over other projectors.” <br /><br />Samsung continues to craft innovative products designed to perform at the highest levels, and the projector line is no exception. Through the embedded file viewer users can open various files including PDF, TXT, HTML, MPEG and Microsoft® Office. This allows for presentations to be viewed using only a USB memory stick. The SP-F10M’s instant on/off functionality enables the projector to turn on and off in just three seconds after pushing the power button. <br /><br />With the Remote Control function, you can remotely control power, volume, input changes and navigate and select files. Diagnostic information such as how long the printer has been running, temperature level and errors can be remotely monitored and controlled in real time. Additionally, the Dust Filter Free internal circulating air flow function saves money and time by improving maintenance efficiency. <br /><br /><br /><br />SP-F10M Key Specs <br /><br />· Unparalleled brightness of 1,000 ANSI lumens from LED-based data projector <br /><br />· LED light source rated at 50,000 hours of life in Eco-mode <br /><br />· XGA (1024x768) native resolution <br /><br />· Image size ranging 40-300 inches <br /><br />· USB port with PC-free File Viewer, allowing presentation of Microsoft® Office and Adobe® PDF documents in their native file format. <br /><br />· HDMI input, along with PC connectivity <br /><br />· RJ45(Network control), MM(Multimedia) <br /><br />· Sound 7W mono <br /><br />· 309.0 x 290.0 x 111.5 (WxDxH, mm) <br /><br />· 4.8 kg <br /><br />· Closed captioning <br /><br /><br /><br />About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. <br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion. Employing approximately 188,000 people in 185 offices across 65 countries, the company consists of eight independently operated business units: Visual Display, Mobile Communications, Telecommunication Systems, Digital Appliances, IT Solutions, Digital Imaging, Semiconductor and LCD.

					Samsung reports quarterly sales of KRW15.52 trillion,<br /><br />operating income of KRW2.14 trillion and net income of KRW2.56 trillion.<br /><br /> <br />				 <br /><br />					 <br />    SEOUL, Korea - January 13, 2006 :  Samsung Electronics <br />        Co., Ltd. today announced its financial results for 2005 fourth quarter <br />        ended December 31, 2005. The company posted net income of 2.56 trillion <br />        won, on revenue of 15.52 trillion won. Operating income for the fourth <br />        quarter was 2.14 trillion won, compared with 2.13 trillion in the previous <br />        quarter.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        Net income in the fourth-quarter increased 36% compared with the previous <br />        quarter, while revenue jumped 7% compared to the previous quarter.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        “Despite challenging market conditions, we achieved strong profit growth <br />        in the fourth quarter driven by healthy, solid results in our key business <br />        units and overseas subsidiaries,” said Dr. Woosik Chu, senior vice president <br />        and head of Samsung Electronics’ investor-relations team. “This is a result <br />        of our competitiveness and focus on innovation.”<br /><br />        <br /><br />        Revenue and operating income growth for the quarter were driven by continued <br />        strength in the Semiconductor and LCD businesses. Operating profit increased <br />        slightly in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter even though the <br />        company set-aside provisions for a newly adopted long-term, incentive-based <br />        compensation structure after the decision to abolish stock-options.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        The company also announced revenue of 57.46 trillion won for the fiscal <br />        year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the fiscal year 2005 was <br />        7.64 trillion won and operating income was 8.06 trillion won.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        Sales and net income of the Semiconductor Business increased to 5.09 trillion <br />        won and 1.62 trillion won, respectively, as demand for NAND Flash chips <br />        used in MP3 players and mobile phones remained robust. Migration to the <br />        finer process technology in NAND Flash helped reduce manufacturing costs <br />        and boost profitability. Operating profit margins stood at 32% in the <br />        fourth-quarter, a 3%-point increase from the previous quarter. <br /><br />        <br /><br />        Samsung expects solid momentum heading into 2006, as demand for value <br />        added, “specialty DRAMs” used in graphic-focused products and 8Gb NAND <br />        Flash is expected to increase.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        The Telecommunication Network Business posted revenue of 4.95 trillion <br />        won, and operating income of 380 billion won. Samsung sold 27.2 million <br />        phones in the fourth quarter, the highest number of units on a quarterly <br />        basis. Demand for D600, 3G phones, and high-end premium phones, remained <br />        strong in the fourth quarter in Europe.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        Samsung expects global demand for mobile phones to increase 5%-10% in <br />        2006, and the company is confident to keep market leadership with the <br />        expansion of the high-end premium handset portfolio including 3G phones <br />        and WiBro.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        The LCD Business reported revenue and operating income of 3.01 trillion <br />        won and 400 billion won, respectively. The full ramp up of the latest <br />        seventh-generation production line helped Samsung Electronics post solid <br />        results and shore up profit margins in the fourth quarter. Margins in <br />        the fourth quarter was 13%, up 2% points from the previous quarter.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        The seventh generation line processes glass sheets that measure 187 centimeters <br />        by 220 centimeters on which eight 40-inch panels or six 46-inch panels <br />        can be made with little waste. In January 2006, Samsung opened a second <br />        production line, or 7-2, and began shipping the first panels off the line. <br />        The two production lines are expected give further cost advantages to <br />        Samsung Electronics.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        Digital Media Business sales decreased to 1.58 trillion won and posted <br />        a 200billion won operating loss. Sales of its Digital Appliance Business <br />        dropped 12% to 750 billion won and operating loss of 60 billion won.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        <br /><br />        About Samsung and

					SEOUL, Korea - January 13, 2006 :  Samsung Electronics <br />        Co., Ltd. today announced its financial results for 2005 fourth quarter <br />        ended December 31, 2005. The company posted net income of 2.56 trillion <br />        won, on revenue of 15.52 trillion won. Operating income for the fourth <br />        quarter was 2.14 trillion won, compared with 2.13 trillion in the previous <br />        quarter.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        Net income in the fourth-quarter increased 36% compared with the previous <br />        quarter, while revenue jumped 7% compared to the previous quarter.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        “Despite challenging market conditions, we achieved strong profit growth <br />        in the fourth quarter driven by healthy, solid results in our key business <br />        units and overseas subsidiaries,” said Dr. Woosik Chu, senior vice president <br />        and head of Samsung Electronics’ investor-relations team. “This is a result <br />        of our competitiveness and focus on innovation.”<br /><br />        <br /><br />        Revenue and operating income growth for the quarter were driven by continued <br />        strength in the Semiconductor and LCD businesses. Operating profit increased <br />        slightly in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter even though the <br />        company set-aside provisions for a newly adopted long-term, incentive-based <br />        compensation structure after the decision to abolish stock-options.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        The company also announced revenue of 57.46 trillion won for the fiscal <br />        year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the fiscal year 2005 was <br />        7.64 trillion won and operating income was 8.06 trillion won.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        Sales and net income of the Semiconductor Business increased to 5.09 trillion <br />        won and 1.62 trillion won, respectively, as demand for NAND Flash chips <br />        used in MP3 players and mobile phones remained robust. Migration to the <br />        finer process technology in NAND Flash helped reduce manufacturing costs <br />        and boost profitability. Operating profit margins stood at 32% in the <br />        fourth-quarter, a 3%-point increase from the previous quarter. <br /><br />        <br /><br />        Samsung expects solid momentum heading into 2006, as demand for value <br />        added, “specialty DRAMs” used in graphic-focused products and 8Gb NAND <br />        Flash is expected to increase.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        The Telecommunication Network Business posted revenue of 4.95 trillion <br />        won, and operating income of 380 billion won. Samsung sold 27.2 million <br />        phones in the fourth quarter, the highest number of units on a quarterly <br />        basis. Demand for D600, 3G phones, and high-end premium phones, remained <br />        strong in the fourth quarter in Europe.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        Samsung expects global demand for mobile phones to increase 5%-10% in <br />        2006, and the company is confident to keep market leadership with the <br />        expansion of the high-end premium handset portfolio including 3G phones <br />        and WiBro.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        The LCD Business reported revenue and operating income of 3.01 trillion <br />        won and 400 billion won, respectively. The full ramp up of the latest <br />        seventh-generation production line helped Samsung Electronics post solid <br />        results and shore up profit margins in the fourth quarter. Margins in <br />        the fourth quarter was 13%, up 2% points from the previous quarter.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        The seventh generation line processes glass sheets that measure 187 centimeters <br />        by 220 centimeters on which eight 40-inch panels or six 46-inch panels <br />        can be made with little waste. In January 2006, Samsung opened a second <br />        production line, or 7-2, and began shipping the first panels off the line. <br />        The two production lines are expected give further cost advantages to <br />        Samsung Electronics.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        Digital Media Business sales decreased to 1.58 trillion won and posted <br />        a 200billion won operating loss. Sales of its Digital Appliance Business <br />        dropped 12% to 750 billion won and operating loss of 60 billion won.<br /><br />        <br /><br />        <br /><br />        About Samsung and

					Seoul, Korea, April 14, 2006 : Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today  announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2006 (ended March 31, 2005). The company posted net income of KRW1.88 trillion on  revenue of KRW13.96 trillion won, a respective 26-percent and 1-percent year-on-year  growth from the same quarter of the prior year. The increase was recorded despite adverse  changes in the exchange rate earlier this year and the decline in sales  prices. While operating income for the first  quarter was KRW1.61 trillion won, net income was higher due to improvements in  non-operating income, including equity gains from the favorable performance of  overseas subsidiaries. <br /><br />    <br /><br />    The Semiconductor Business recorded  declines in sales and operating income, at KRW4.33 trillion and KRW1.12  trillion, respectively, at the close of the quarter. The decrease is attributed to falling NAND flash  memory prices in the traditionally slow first quarter and the change in the  exchange rate. However, DRAM prices  sustained levels of the prior quarter, notwithstanding the seasonality, from an  increase in demand of DDR2 DRAMs. The sales  portion of specialty DRAM products, such as mobile and graphic DRAM, expanded, bolstering  operating margins.<br /><br />    <br /><br />    In the second quarter, a 10-percent  quarter-on-quarter bit growth through increased production of DDR2 products and  continued favorable levels of demand for mobile and graphic DRAM products will  contribute to higher revenue and profit figures. NAND flash memory prices will stabilize as  demand will increase with growing utilization in upgraded multi-functional  video and gaming products. In addition, Samsung  expects to see visible signs of strengthening demand resulting from the first  quarter price declines. <br /><br /><br /><br />The Telecommunication Network  Business shipped 29 million mobile phones in the first quarter. Despite increasing competition in the global  mobile phone market, the company recorded its highest ever quarterly sales  volume. However, the challenging foreign  exchange rate and average sales price decline negatively impacted revenue,  which decreased to KRW4.59 trillion from the previous quarter. Operating income increased by over 20-percent  to KRW460 billion in the same period from marketing cost-saving efforts. As a  result, operating margins improved to double digit levels, at over 10-percent. <br /><br /><br /><br />Samsung anticipates volume growth in  the second quarter with an expanded portfolio of high-end premium mobile phones  that will include roll-outs of 2-megapixel and higher multi-functional slim  phones and next-generation 3G HSDPA-based phones.<br /><br /><br /><br />The LCD Business reported revenue  and operating income of KRW2.68 trillion and KRW110 billion, respectively. Stagnant demand in the slow first quarter and  decline in LCD panel prices are cited for the decline from the previous quarter. In the 40-inch and larger LCD TV panel  segment, Samsung experienced a substantial 20% rise in volume at 600 thousand  units. <br /><br /><br /><br />In the  second quarter, the company expects stabilization of market prices and sales  growth as demand for large-sized TVs increases ahead of World Cup. In early January, the cost to bring Line 7-2  operational was significant but in the second quarter, the ramp-up of Line 7-2 to  45 thousand substrates per month will conclude, which will place the company in  an advantageous position in the 40-inch and larger TV panel market segment. Cost competitiveness will strengthen,  contributing to improved operating margins.<br /><br /><br /><br />Digital Media Business sales decreased  to KRW1.56 trillion due to seasonality and the exchange rate. Operating losses improved by KRW 150 billion to  KRW50 billion from the prior quarter due to higher sales of premium-level LCD  and PDP TVs and increases in LCD TV market share in the US market. In particular, around 40% of the KRW420 billion in equity gains resulted  from solid digital media product sales performance at the overseas subsidiaries,  reflecting a stronger profit positioning of the business.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Digital Appliance Business posted sales of  KRW690 billion and operating loss of KRW18 billion. Despite the revenue decrease, the business  reduced loss levels by KRW50 billion through the sales increase of premium  products, such as refrigerators and drum-type washing machines.<br /><br /><br /><br />Woosik Chu, senior vice president  and head of the investor relations team at Samsung Electronics stated, “Profit  levels declined in the past quarter because of market challenges such as the  exchange rate. Excluding the exchange  rate variable, the financial results were on the whole reasonable.”<br /><br /><br /><br />He added, “Management remains positive on  performance for the second quarter because of the many promising business  prospects although the exchange rate will remain a variable. In the Semiconductor Business, demand is  expected to pick up with the first quarter decline of NAND flash memory prices,  the start of 8Gb NAND flash memory and 60-nanometer process technology  production will bring cost advantages, and sales of specialty DRAM products  like graphic and mobile will increase. In  the LCD Business, price declines will slow down and yields will stabilize in  Line 7-2 resulting in improved cost competitiveness. The Telecommunication Network Business  expects growth in sales volume with the launch of next-generation 3G HSDPA-based  phones and a variety of multi-functional slim phones.”      <br />      <br

					Samsung Electronics reports revenue of KRW14.11 trillion,<br /><br />operating income of KRW1.42 trillion and net income of KRW1.51 trillion<br /><br /> <br />				  <br />					 <br />    SEOUL, Korea - July 14, 2006 :Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced its financial results for the  second quarter of 2006 (ended June 30, 2006). The company  posted net income of 1.51 trillion won on revenue of 14.11 trillion won.  Operating income for the second quarter was 1.42 trillion won. <br /><br />      <br /><br />“During the second quarter, many companies in the same industry faced difficulties  due to declining prices in mainstay products,” said Dr. Woosik Chu, senior vice  president and head of Samsung Electronics’ investor-relations team. <br /><br /><br /><br />“However, it’s noteworthy that operating profit exceeded market expectations  amid a challenging market environment in the previous quarter? a result of our  competitiveness and focus on innovation. We expect the second quarter to mark  the trough and anticipate improvements in the second half of this year.  Already, we saw market conditions for NAND flash, LCDs, and handsets stabilizing  in the second quarter.”<br /><br /><br /><br />Operating profit of the Semiconductor Business reached 980 billion won on  revenue of 4.42 trillion won in the second quarter. Operating profit dropped  12% in the second quarter from the first quarter, mainly due to a drop in NAND  flash chip prices.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the DRAM business, profit margins continued to improve in premium  products, such as mobile and graphics, while prices for DDR1 and DDR2 were  strong amidst difficulties by competitors to migrate to 90nm processing  technology.<br /><br /><br /><br />Seasonality played a part in the price declines in the NAND flash memory  market, however prices began to stabilize in the middle of May and conditions  are expected to improve in the second half with rising demand.<br /><br /><br /><br />Introduction of new products that require larger memory such as MP3s, PMPs,  and handsets is expected to boost demand. In addition, conditions will improve  with the seasonal demand pick up in the third quarter and migration to the  finer process technology, in particular 60nm technology, will reduce  manufacturing costs, boosting profitability.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Telecommunication Network Business posted revenue of 4.28 trillion won,  and operating income of 405 billion won.<br /><br /><br /><br />The pace of the demand increase is expected to accelerate in the  third-quarter as the overall 3G market grows and demand for replacement rises. Should  sales of Samsung Electronics’ “Ultra edition” handsets gain traction, the  company expects both the volume of sales and ASP to see significant  improvement.<br /><br /><br /><br />The LCD Business reported revenue and operating income of 2.85 trillion won  and 75 billion won, respectively. Sales of 40-inch and larger panels jumped 87%  quarter-on-quarter to 1.2 million panels due to strong demand for larger TVs.  The profitability of the LCD Business in the previous quarter was a testament  to Samsung Electronics’ competitiveness in the industry, as the climate for the  LCD market was weak.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the third quarter, increased demand for LCD TV panels is expected to  dominate the industry dynamics. This will square favorably with an expected  rise in demand for IT-related products. Thus, LCD panel prices are expected to  stabilize.<br /><br /><br /><br />Samsung Electronics plans to boost monthly capacity of its Line 7-1, the  S-LCD joint venture, to an additional 15,000 units during the third quarter to accommodate  the increasing demand for larger TVs and strengthen its market leadership in  this segment. Cost leadership in TV panels, early adoption of the 7G line and  economies of scale continue to be the strengths of Samsung Electronics.<br /><br /><br /><br />Digital Media Business posted an operating loss of 60 billion won on  revenue of 1.66 trillion won. Sales remained at the same level despite  seasonality with the favorable sales of its premium-level LCD and PDP TVs such  as the “Bordeaux” LCD TV. The  majority of the 230 billion won in equity gains was generated from sales of digital  media products at the overseas subsidiaries, reflecting a stronger profit position.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sales  of its Digital Appliance Business increased 13% quarter-on-quarter to 770 billion  won with seasonal gains in air-conditioner sales. Operating loss was at 3  billion won. <br />          <br />    <br />        <br />          Revenue  by Business<br />          (in trillion won)<br />        <br />      <br />      <br />

					SEOUL, Korea - July 14, 2006 :Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced its financial results for the  second quarter of 2006 (ended June 30, 2006). The company  posted net income of 1.51 trillion won on revenue of 14.11 trillion won.  Operating income for the second quarter was 1.42 trillion won. <br /><br />      <br /><br />“During the second quarter, many companies in the same industry faced difficulties  due to declining prices in mainstay products,” said Dr. Woosik Chu, senior vice  president and head of Samsung Electronics’ investor-relations team. <br /><br /><br /><br />“However, it’s noteworthy that operating profit exceeded market expectations  amid a challenging market environment in the previous quarter? a result of our  competitiveness and focus on innovation. We expect the second quarter to mark  the trough and anticipate improvements in the second half of this year.  Already, we saw market conditions for NAND flash, LCDs, and handsets stabilizing  in the second quarter.”<br /><br /><br /><br />Operating profit of the Semiconductor Business reached 980 billion won on  revenue of 4.42 trillion won in the second quarter. Operating profit dropped  12% in the second quarter from the first quarter, mainly due to a drop in NAND  flash chip prices.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the DRAM business, profit margins continued to improve in premium  products, such as mobile and graphics, while prices for DDR1 and DDR2 were  strong amidst difficulties by competitors to migrate to 90nm processing  technology.<br /><br /><br /><br />Seasonality played a part in the price declines in the NAND flash memory  market, however prices began to stabilize in the middle of May and conditions  are expected to improve in the second half with rising demand.<br /><br /><br /><br />Introduction of new products that require larger memory such as MP3s, PMPs,  and handsets is expected to boost demand. In addition, conditions will improve  with the seasonal demand pick up in the third quarter and migration to the  finer process technology, in particular 60nm technology, will reduce  manufacturing costs, boosting profitability.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Telecommunication Network Business posted revenue of 4.28 trillion won,  and operating income of 405 billion won.<br /><br /><br /><br />The pace of the demand increase is expected to accelerate in the  third-quarter as the overall 3G market grows and demand for replacement rises. Should  sales of Samsung Electronics’ “Ultra edition” handsets gain traction, the  company expects both the volume of sales and ASP to see significant  improvement.<br /><br /><br /><br />The LCD Business reported revenue and operating income of 2.85 trillion won  and 75 billion won, respectively. Sales of 40-inch and larger panels jumped 87%  quarter-on-quarter to 1.2 million panels due to strong demand for larger TVs.  The profitability of the LCD Business in the previous quarter was a testament  to Samsung Electronics’ competitiveness in the industry, as the climate for the  LCD market was weak.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the third quarter, increased demand for LCD TV panels is expected to  dominate the industry dynamics. This will square favorably with an expected  rise in demand for IT-related products. Thus, LCD panel prices are expected to  stabilize.<br /><br /><br /><br />Samsung Electronics plans to boost monthly capacity of its Line 7-1, the  S-LCD joint venture, to an additional 15,000 units during the third quarter to accommodate  the increasing demand for larger TVs and strengthen its market leadership in  this segment. Cost leadership in TV panels, early adoption of the 7G line and  economies of scale continue to be the strengths of Samsung Electronics.<br /><br /><br /><br />Digital Media Business posted an operating loss of 60 billion won on  revenue of 1.66 trillion won. Sales remained at the same level despite  seasonality with the favorable sales of its premium-level LCD and PDP TVs such  as the “Bordeaux” LCD TV. The  majority of the 230 billion won in equity gains was generated from sales of digital  media products at the overseas subsidiaries, reflecting a stronger profit position.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sales  of its Digital Appliance Business increased 13% quarter-on-quarter to 770 billion  won with seasonal gains in air-conditioner sales. Operating loss was at 3  billion won. <br />          <br />    <br />        <br />          Revenue  by Business<br />          (in trillion won)<br />        <br />      <br />      <br />

					Samsung Electronics reports revenue of KRW15.22 trillion,<br /><br />operating income of KRW 1.85 trillion and net income of KRW2.19 trillion<br /><br /> <br />				  <br />					   <br />    SEOUL, Korea - October 16, 2006   : Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2006 (ended September 30, 2006). The company posted net income of 2.19 trillion won on revenue of 15.22 trillion won. Operating income for the third quarter was 1.85 trillion won.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      <br />      "Our strategy of producing high performance, differentiated products into multiple end markets allowed us to power ahead and deliver solid third quarter results amid a challenging market environment of the information-technology sector," said Dr. Woosik Chu, senior vice president and head of Samsung Electronics' investor-relations team.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      <br />      "We anticipate our key business units to experience significant tailwinds in the fourth quarter, a seasonally strong period. Furthermore, our plan to invest an additional 1 trillion won to increase capacity of our memory-chip business is expected to create revenue opportunities next year."<br /><br />      <br /><br />      Operating profit of the Semiconductor Business reached 1.27 trillion won on revenue of 4.91 trillion won in the third quarter. Operating profit increased 29.5% in the third quarter from the second quarter, mainly due to strong demand of memory chips from the PC sector.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      In the memory-chip business, Samsung Electronics capitalized on the global shortage in supply of DRAM chips that subsequently led to a surge in DRAM prices. A timely redeployment of production from slower-growth products and strengthening higher-growth, premium products such as DDR2, enhanced profit margins by 3.7 percentage points from the previous quarter.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      The memory business is expected to see further growth and higher returns in the fourth quarter, a seasonally strong period. The price of DRAM chips is expected to remain strong in the fourth quarter, and the demand of NAND flash memory chips is expected to grow with the introduction of new products that require larger memory such as MP3s, PMPs, and handsets.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      In addition, migration to the advanced process technology, in particular 60-nanometer (nm) 8-Gigabit (Gb) NAND Flash technology, is expected to reduce manufacturing costs and improve profitability. Samsung Electronics' plan to invest an additional 1 trillion won to increase production capacity of memory chips is expected to create revenue opportunities next year.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      The Telecommunication Network Business posted revenue of 4.71 trillion won, and operating income of 520 billion won. <br /><br />      In the third quarter, robust sales of the "Ultra Edition" premium handsets in Europe helped boost sales to a record 30.7 million units and double-digit profit margins of 11.1%. <br /><br />      <br /><br />      In the fourth-quarter, the pace of the demand increase is expected to accelerate as the overall 3G market grows and demand for replacement rises. The company expects both the volume of sales and average sales price (ASP) to see significant improvement with the launching of 3G "Ultra Edition" handsets in various form factors and multimedia handsets.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      <br />      The LCD Business reported revenue and operating income of 2.996 trillion won and 160 billion won, respectively. Prices of IT panels recovered ahead of the seasonally-robust period and sales of 40-inch and larger TV panels remained strong.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      Samsung Electronics' ability to once again outperform an overall weak LCD market reinforced the company's competitiveness in the industry. <br /><br />      <br /><br />      Demand for LCD TV panels dominated the industry dynamics. Samsung Electronics sold 3 million units of LCD TV panels, of which sales of 40-inch and larger TV panels amounted to 1.6 million units. Samsung Electronics continues to asset its leadership in the LCD TV panel market, which grew 37% from the second quarter.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      Samsung Electronics plans to boost monthly production capacity of its Line 7 to an additional 150,000 units in the fourth-quarter, a busy selling season.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      Digital Media Business posted an operating loss of 100 billion won on revenue of 1.64 trillion won, on a parent basis. However, sales of LCD TV, PDP TV and other high-end flat-panel TV fared well, generating formidable profit for the company.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      Equity gains, which better depict the global performance of the Digital Media Business, jumped to 540 billion won in the third quarter from 290 billion won in the second quarter. The majority of the equity gains were generated from strong sales of digital media products including LCD TVs.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      Sales of its Digital Appliance Business increased 7.6% quarter-on-quarter to 830 billion won from favorable sales of refrigerators and washing machines. Operating loss was at 14.8 billion won.<br /><br />        <br /><br />      <br />        <br />          Revenue  by Business<br />          (in trillion won)<br />        <br />      <br />

The company expects both the volume of sales and average sales price (ASP) to see significant improvement with the launching of 3G "Ultra Edition" handsets in various form factors and multimedia handsets.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      <br />      The LCD Business reported revenue and operating income of 2.996 trillion won and 160 billion won, respectively. Prices of IT panels recovered ahead of the seasonally-robust period and sales of 40-inch and larger TV panels remained strong.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      Samsung Electronics' ability to once again outperform an overall weak LCD market reinforced the company's competitiveness in the industry. <br /><br />      <br /><br />      Demand for LCD TV panels dominated the industry dynamics. Samsung Electronics sold 3 million units of LCD TV panels, of which sales of 40-inch and larger TV panels amounted to 1.6 million units. Samsung Electronics continues to asset its leadership in the LCD TV panel market, which grew 37% from the second quarter.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      Samsung Electronics plans to boost monthly production capacity of its Line 7 to an additional 150,000 units in the fourth-quarter, a busy selling season.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      Digital Media Business posted an operating loss of 100 billion won on revenue of 1.64 trillion won, on a parent basis. However, sales of LCD TV, PDP TV and other high-end flat-panel TV fared well, generating formidable profit for the company.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      Equity gains, which better depict the global performance of the Digital Media Business, jumped to 540 billion won in the third quarter from 290 billion won in the second quarter. The majority of the equity gains were generated from strong sales of digital media products including LCD TVs.<br /><br />      <br /><br />      Sales of its Digital Appliance Business increased 7.6% quarter-on-quarter to 830 billion won from favorable sales of refrigerators and washing machines. Operating loss was at 14.8 billion won.<br /><br />        <br /><br />      <br />        <br />          Revenue  by Business<br />          (in trillion won)<br />        <br />      <br />

					Samsung Electronics reports revenue of KRW 15.69 trillion, operating income of KRW 2.05 trillion and net income of KRW 2.35 trillion<br /><br /> <br />				  <br />SEOUL, Korea – January 12, 2007: Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced fourth quarter revenue of 15.69 trillion won for the period ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 3% over the previous quarter. Operating income for the quarter was 2.05 trillion won, an 11% increase compared with 1.85 trillion in the previous quarter. Net income for the quarter was 2.35 trillion won, a 7% increase over the previous quarter. <br />    “In the fourth quarter, key products powered a recovery in overall earnings despite price declines in some product categories, Samsung's differentiation strategy continues to boost profitability.” said Dr. Woosik Chu, senior vice president and head of Samsung Electronics' investor-relations team. <br />    Operating income and net income growth for the quarter were driven by the strong performances of the Semiconductor and LCD businesses. Operating profit growth was in the double digits even though the company spent 0.53 trillion won more in marketing over the previous quarter. In addition, net income rose above market expectations because of buoyant profitability from the company's overseas operations, which are reflected as equity gains. <br />    Sales and operating income of the Semiconductor Business increased to 5.42 trillion won and 1.66 trillion won, respectively, as the price of DRAMs remained robust due to strong seasonal demand for personal computers. Strong profitability continued through the efforts to enhance the product mix, such as increasing production ratio of the DDR2. The expanded transition to 60-nanometer (nm) NAND Flash technology and Multi Level Cell technology reduced manufacturing costs and further improved profitability in spite of a decline in NAND prices in December. <br />    The Telecommunication Network Business posted revenue of 4.65 trillion won, and operating income of 0.35 trillion won. Samsung sold 32 million phones in the fourth quarter, a record high on a quarterly basis due to strong sales of the popular Ultra Edition line. Annual unit sales reached 118 million, surpassing the business unit's annual target figure. Marketing expenditure increases for end-of-the-year sales promotions negatively impacted operating income. <br />    In 2007, Samsung will strengthen its high-performance, premium line-up with the launch of 30 some WCDMA phones and specialty phones that focus on music, video, and messaging functions. <br />    The LCD Business reported revenue and operating income of 3.18 trillion won and 0.31 trillion won, respectively. Revenue and operating margins in the quarter posted a 6% and a 90% increase compared with the previous quarter, respectively. Strong seasonal demand for panels for IT products, such as monitors and note PCs, and a mitigated price drop for 40-inch and larger panels helped Samsung Electronics post solid results in the fourth quarter. The quarterly sales of LCD TV panels recorded 3 million units and the annual sales reached 11 million units. In particular, Samsung Electronics achieved sales of 5 million units in the company's differentiated 40-inch and larger panel category for a market share of 60%, further extending its leadership in the LCD TV panel market <br />    Digital Media Business posted revenue of 1.45 trillion won and operating loss of 150 billion won on a non-consolidated basis. However, equity gains generated from sales of digital media products at the overseas subsidiaries, greatly contributed to the overall profitability of the company on a consolidated basis. In particular, the TV business is now number 1 on both a volume and revenue basis in the overall TV, flat-panel TV and LCD TV markets worldwide. Samsung Electronics became the first company in the industry to achieve sales of over $10 billion with 2006 sales of $10.8 billion. <br />    Due to seasonality, sales of the Digital Appliance Business dropped five percent compared to the previous quarter and posted operating loss of 0.14 trillion won. <br />    For the outlook of the first quarter, Dr. Chu said, “Samsung Electronics anticipates challenges in key product areas in the quarter, a seasonally weak period. However, we expect stable overall performance in the first quarter with higher demand for DRAM and IT panels from the launch of Windows Vista, a sales increase during the Chinese New Year and the recovery of profits in the mobile phone business.“ He added, “Our key businesses, such as DRAMs, NAND flash memory chips, LCDs, mobile phones, and flat-panel TVs, will enter into a growth momentum after the first half and we expect significant growth both in revenue and profits in the second half.” <br />    Samsung Electronics earmarked 8.1trillion won in capital expenditure for 2007. While the actual amount is a slight decline from the previous year, the expenditure is relatively similar to 2006 levels considering the advanced spending of 1 trillion won at the end of 2006, foreign exchange effects, and the spending of 1.6 trillion won at Samsung Austin Semiconductor and S-LCD in 2007.<br />    <br /><br />        <br /><br />        <br /><br />        Revenue by Business  (in

					SEOUL, Korea – January 12, 2007: Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced fourth quarter revenue of 15.69 trillion won for the period ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 3% over the previous quarter. Operating income for the quarter was 2.05 trillion won, an 11% increase compared with 1.85 trillion in the previous quarter. Net income for the quarter was 2.35 trillion won, a 7% increase over the previous quarter. <br />    “In the fourth quarter, key products powered a recovery in overall earnings despite price declines in some product categories, Samsung's differentiation strategy continues to boost profitability.” said Dr. Woosik Chu, senior vice president and head of Samsung Electronics' investor-relations team. <br />    Operating income and net income growth for the quarter were driven by the strong performances of the Semiconductor and LCD businesses. Operating profit growth was in the double digits even though the company spent 0.53 trillion won more in marketing over the previous quarter. In addition, net income rose above market expectations because of buoyant profitability from the company's overseas operations, which are reflected as equity gains. <br />    Sales and operating income of the Semiconductor Business increased to 5.42 trillion won and 1.66 trillion won, respectively, as the price of DRAMs remained robust due to strong seasonal demand for personal computers. Strong profitability continued through the efforts to enhance the product mix, such as increasing production ratio of the DDR2. The expanded transition to 60-nanometer (nm) NAND Flash technology and Multi Level Cell technology reduced manufacturing costs and further improved profitability in spite of a decline in NAND prices in December. <br />    The Telecommunication Network Business posted revenue of 4.65 trillion won, and operating income of 0.35 trillion won. Samsung sold 32 million phones in the fourth quarter, a record high on a quarterly basis due to strong sales of the popular Ultra Edition line. Annual unit sales reached 118 million, surpassing the business unit's annual target figure. Marketing expenditure increases for end-of-the-year sales promotions negatively impacted operating income. <br />    In 2007, Samsung will strengthen its high-performance, premium line-up with the launch of 30 some WCDMA phones and specialty phones that focus on music, video, and messaging functions. <br />    The LCD Business reported revenue and operating income of 3.18 trillion won and 0.31 trillion won, respectively. Revenue and operating margins in the quarter posted a 6% and a 90% increase compared with the previous quarter, respectively. Strong seasonal demand for panels for IT products, such as monitors and note PCs, and a mitigated price drop for 40-inch and larger panels helped Samsung Electronics post solid results in the fourth quarter. The quarterly sales of LCD TV panels recorded 3 million units and the annual sales reached 11 million units. In particular, Samsung Electronics achieved sales of 5 million units in the company's differentiated 40-inch and larger panel category for a market share of 60%, further extending its leadership in the LCD TV panel market <br />    Digital Media Business posted revenue of 1.45 trillion won and operating loss of 150 billion won on a non-consolidated basis. However, equity gains generated from sales of digital media products at the overseas subsidiaries, greatly contributed to the overall profitability of the company on a consolidated basis. In particular, the TV business is now number 1 on both a volume and revenue basis in the overall TV, flat-panel TV and LCD TV markets worldwide. Samsung Electronics became the first company in the industry to achieve sales of over $10 billion with 2006 sales of $10.8 billion. <br />    Due to seasonality, sales of the Digital Appliance Business dropped five percent compared to the previous quarter and posted operating loss of 0.14 trillion won. <br />    For the outlook of the first quarter, Dr. Chu said, “Samsung Electronics anticipates challenges in key product areas in the quarter, a seasonally weak period. However, we expect stable overall performance in the first quarter with higher demand for DRAM and IT panels from the launch of Windows Vista, a sales increase during the Chinese New Year and the recovery of profits in the mobile phone business.“ He added, “Our key businesses, such as DRAMs, NAND flash memory chips, LCDs, mobile phones, and flat-panel TVs, will enter into a growth momentum after the first half and we expect significant growth both in revenue and profits in the second half.” <br />    Samsung Electronics earmarked 8.1trillion won in capital expenditure for 2007. While the actual amount is a slight decline from the previous year, the expenditure is relatively similar to 2006 levels considering the advanced spending of 1 trillion won at the end of 2006, foreign exchange effects, and the spending of 1.6 trillion won at Samsung Austin Semiconductor and S-LCD in 2007.<br />    <br /><br />        <br /><br />        <br /><br />        Revenue by Business  (in

					SEOUL, Korea - April 13, 2007 : Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced financial results for its 2007 first quarter ended  March 31, 2007. For the quarter, the company posted a net profit of 1.60  trillion won on revenue of 14.39 trillion won. Operating profit for the  quarter was 1.18 trillion won.<br /><br /><br />There were many difficulties in the first quarter due to a sluggish demand  for key products and a decline in their prices due to an oversupply in a  seasonally weak period of the IT Industry, said Samsung Electronics’ investor-relations  team.<br /><br />      <br />Nevertheless, we believe we have secured a footing for better earnings  by focusing on enhancing competitiveness in the long run rather than pursuing  short-term profits,” it said, noting that the price for semiconductor products  began to stabilize in March and market conditions is expected to recover  in the second half.<br /><br />      <br />Operating profit of the Semiconductor Business reached 540 billion won on revenue of 4.48 trillion won in the first quarter. The decline in the operating profit was mainly due a sluggish demand for both DRAM and NAND flash memory chips due to seasonality. <br /><br /><br />Temporary capacity of DRAM chips decreased due to a transition from 8-inch wafer to 12-inch wafer in some Fabs in the first quarter. However, the company  expects to gain cost leadership via the 12-inch wafer transition.<br /><br />      <br />The Semiconductor Business’ profit was also hurt by the price of NAND flash  memory chips in the industry, which fell nearly 50 percent in the first  quarter. However, the company is expected to benefit from maintaining favorable  portfolio mix of DRAM and NAND amid expectations that the NAND flash memory  chip prices will rise in the second half due to a supply shortage and rising<br />demands.<br />      <br /><br />In addition, migration to the 50-nm technology is expected to help the company  secure cost leadership in the second half.  <br /><br />The company expects DRAM chip price to stabilize because price elasticity  of DRAM will drive the main memory demand for PCs.     <br /><br /><br />The Telecommunication Business posted an operating profit of 600 billion  won on revenue of 4.6 trillion won. Operating profit margin was 13 percent  in the first quarter.<br /><br />      <br />Robust sales of premium handsets, including the “Ultra Edition,” and a solid  performance in China and other emerging markets helped boost sales to a  record of 34.8 million units.<br /><br />     <br />The strong performance is impressive considering the fact that first quarter is traditionally a seasonally weak period.      <br /><br /><br />The Telecommunication Network Business plans to expand the sales of handsets by continuously launching more premium handsets, and expects to exceed its  annual sale target of 133 million units.<br /><br /><br />In the first quarter, the company changed its handset shipment and ASP calculation  standard from headquarters shipment based to global sales based.<br /><br /><br />The LCD Business posted a revenue of 2.84 trillion won, and operating profit  was 73.1 billion won. The 11 percent drop in revenue from the previous quarter was due to sluggish demand for large panels and a continued drop in panel prices.<br /><br />      <br />In the second half, the LCD Business expects seasonality to help increase  demand for panels, and expects to see higher returns with the eighth-generation line starting operation earlier than heduled.<br /><br /><br />The Digital Media Business posted an operating loss of 35.5 billion won on revenue of 1.55 trillion won, on a parent basis. The robust sales of   “Bordeaux TVs” generated profit for the company.<br /><br />      <br />In the second half, the Digital Media expects its sales and profit margin  to improve with its hit “Bordeaux TV” and the launch of new products that  is unique in design and function.<br /><br />      <br />The Digital Appliance Division posted a revenue of 770 billion won thanks  to strong sales of air conditioners and its efforts to reduce costs. Operating loss was at 200 million won, a major improvement from the previous quarter. <br /><br /><br />[Revenue by Business : SEE 2nd IMAGE]<br />        <br />      <br />[Operating Profit by Business : SEE 3rd IMAGE]<br />        <br />      <br />About Samsung Electronics<br /><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, <br />digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2006 parent company <br />sales of US$63.4 billion and net income of US$8.5 billion.

					Seoul, Korea – April 23, 2007 : Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., the world leader in advanced semiconductor technology solutions, today announced that it has developed the first all-DRAM stacked memory package using ‘through silicon via’ (TSV) technology, which will soon result in memory packages that are faster, smaller and consume less power.<br /><br />The new wafer-level-processed stacked package (WSP) consists of four 512 megabit (Mb) DDR2 (second generation, double data rate) DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chips that offer a combined 2 gigabits (Gb) of high density memory. Using the TSV-processed 2Gb DRAMs, Samsung can create a 4 GB (gigabyte) DIMM (dual in-line memory module) based on advanced WSP technology for the first time. Samsung’s proprietary WSP technology not only reduces the overall package size, but also permits the chips to operate faster and use less power.<br /><br />“The innovative TSV-based MCP (multi-chip package) stacking technology offers next-generation packaging solution that will accommodate the ever-growing demand for smaller-sized, high-speed, high-density memory,” said Tae-Gyeong Chung, vice president, Interconnect Technology Development Team, Memory Division, Samsung Electronics. “In addition, the performance advancements achieved by our WSP technology can be utilized in many diverse combinations of semiconductor packaging, such as system-in-package solutions that combine logic with memory.<br /><br />In today’s MCPs, memory chips are connected by wire bonding, requiring vertical spacing between dies that is tens of microns deep. That wire bonding process also requires horizontal spacing on the package board hundreds of microns wide for the die-connecting wires. By contrast, Samsung’s WSP technology forms laser-cut micron-sized holes that penetrate the silicon vertically to connect the memory circuits directly with a copper (Cu) filling, eliminating the need for gaps of extra space and wires protruding beyond the sides of the dies. These advantages permit Samsung’s WSP to offer a significantly smaller footprint and thinner package.<br /><br />Inside the new WSP, the TSV is housed within an aluminum (Al) pad to escape the performance-slow-down effect caused by the redistribution layer. Due to the complexity of DRAM stacking, this represented a much more difficult engineering feat than that accomplished with the first WSP, announced last year involving NAND flash dies.<br /><br />There has been considerable concern that MCPs with high-speed memory chips with speed of 1.6Gb/ps next generation DRAM, would suffer from performance limitations when connected using current technologies. Samsung’s WSP technology resolves these concerns.<br /><br />In addition, as the back side of the wafer is ground away to make a thinner stack of multiple dies, the wafer has had a tendency to curve, creating physical distortion in the die. To overcome this additional critical concern in designing low-profile, high-density MCPs containing DRAM circuitry, Samsung’s proprietary wafer-thinning technology, announced last year, has been applied to improve the thin-die-cutting process.<br /><br />Advanced package solutions are increasingly important requirements for enabling high-speed, high-density memory solutions. Samsung’s new stacked package design supports the rapid industry demand for high density, high performance semiconductor solutions that will support next-generation computing systems in 2010 and beyond.<br /><br />About Samsung Electronics<br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2006 parent company sales of US$63.4 billion and net income of US$8.5 billion. Employing approximately 138,000 people in 124 offices in 56 countries, the company consists of five main business units: Digital Media Business, LCD Business, Semiconductor Business, Telecommunication Network Business, and Digital Appliance Business.

					Using Finest Process Technology to Accelerate Data Speeds<br /> <br />Seoul, Korea - April, 29, 2007 : Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a leader in advanced semiconductor technology, announced today that it has become the first to begin mass producing 16 gigabit (Gb) NAND flash, the highest capacity memory chip now available. The company said it will fabricate the devices in 51 nanometers (nm), the finest process technology to be used in memory mass production to date.<br /><br />"In rolling out the densest NAND flash in the world, we are throwing open the gates to a much wider playing field for flash-driven consumer electronics," said Jim Elliott, director, flash marketing, Samsung Semiconductor. "To minimize production costs and improve performance, we have applied the finest process technology a ‘half generation’ ahead of the industry, which is introducing 55nm and higher."<br /><br />Samsung's 51nm NAND flash chips can be produced 60 percent more efficiently than those produced with 60nm process technology. Samsung achieved this new migration milestone just eight months after announcing production of its 60nm 8Gb NAND flash last August.<br /><br />The new 16Gb chip which has a multi-level cell (MLC) structure can facilitate capacity expansion by offering 16 gigabytes (GBs) of memory in a single memory card. Furthermore, by applying the new process technology, Samsung has accelerated the chip's read and write speeds by approximately 80 percent over current MLC data processing speeds.<br /><br />NAND flash memory reads and writes data in units called "pages." The 60nm NAND flash memory is designed with a 2 KiloByte (KB) page size, but the 51nm 16Gb version can process data in 4 KB pages, nearly doubling the data rate. The product also maintains the same 4 bit error-correcting code (ECC) capability as that of 60nm NAND, allowing customers to use existing system interfaces with only minor firmware upgrades. With its 4 bit ECC, Samsung eliminates the need to secure a better ECC capability to assure sufficient reliability, which would have required new costly controllers.<br /><br />Samsung will offer an optimized suite of Flash software and firmware-incorporated storage devices for music phones and MP3 players to support 4KB pages. It also will provide a multi-plane performance optimization feature and wear-leveling for improved reliability. Memory cards and MP3 controllers to support the 4KB-page are already available,<br /><br />Technology migration to 16Gb is expected to boost the recent explosive demand for high-density data storage in high-end music phones and the phenomenal trend toward user created content (UCC). As the demand for video content grows stronger by the day, products that feature extended recording time of high-resolution video footage, including mid-to-high-range digital cameras, will particularly benefit from the high capacity and performance of 16Gb NAND flash memory.<br /><br />With support technology in place, demand for 16Gb NAND flash memory is expected to grow rapidly, pushing this new chip into the mainstream market beginning late this year. Aggregate global sales through 2010 are estimated to be US$21 billion.<br /><br />About Samsung Electronics<br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2006 parent company sales of US$63.4 billion and net income of US$8.5 billion. Employing approximately 138,000 people in 124 offices in 56 countries, the company consists of five main business units: Digital Media Business, LCD Business, Semiconductor Business, Telecommunication Network Business, and Digital Appliance Business.

					SEOUL, Korea - July 13, 2007: Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2007 ended June 30, 2007. For the quarter, the company posted a net income of 1.42 trillion won on revenue of 14.63 trillion won. Operating profit for the quarter was 0.91 trillion won on a parent basis or about 1.4 trillion won on a consolidated basis. <br /><br />Strong performances by the company’s Telecommunication Network and LCD Businesses, and a turnaround by the Digital Appliance Division, highlighted a quarter in which a challenging semiconductor market resulted in a decline in operating profit for the Semiconductor Business.<br /><br />“During the second quarter, most business divisions of the company performed well,” said Dr. Woosik Chu, executive vice president and head of Samsung Electronics’ investor relations team. “The major exception was semiconductor, which is still well positioned to recover in the second half of this year, and is also pursuing major enhancements in competitiveness that will come to fruition in 2008 and afterwards.”<br /><br />Operating profit of the Semiconductor Business reached 330 billion won on revenue of 4.26 trillion won in the second quarter. The decline in operating profit was due mainly to a sharp drop in DRAM pricing amid high level of supply. <br /><br />In the second half of the year, the Semiconductor Business is expected to improve its profit margin further as the high-demand season starts and the company’s cost competitiveness measures continue to take effect.<br /><br />In the DRAM business, the company is anticipating improvements in its cost competitiveness by transitioning to 80nm to 68nm technology in the second half.  Prices of NAND flash chips will also begin to stabilize in the second half of the year following the introduction of new products that require larger memory, such as new mobile handsets and Note PC/UMPC with Solid State Discs. <br /><br />The Telecommunication Network Business posted an operating profit of 350 billion won on revenue of 4.50 trillion won. On a consolidated basis, operating margins show a steady performance of 500 billion won. <br /><br />Robust sales of premium handsets, including the “Ultra Edition,” and a solid performance in emerging markets helped boost sales to a record of 37.4 million units for a single quarter. This strong performance led the company to increase its annual sales target to more than 150 million units. <br /><br />The company is expanding sales and market share in emerging markets and is also focusing on innovations of the handset development processes to eliminate production inefficiency. These activities include re-establishing global supply chain management, outsourcing components at the global manufacturing bases, shortening manufacturing process and introducing new cost-effective platforms. Results of these activities are expected to appear in 2008.<br /><br />The LCD Business posted revenues of 3.34 trillion won, with operating profit of 290 billion won. Operating profit almost quadrupled from the previous quarter despite traditionally sluggish demand for LCD products in the second quarter. The company demonstrated the value of its increasing market share by breaking the sales mark of 2 million units for 40-inch or larger sized panels in a single quarter. <br /><br />In the second half of 2007, the LCD Business expects to record double-digit operating income thanks to cost competitiveness and increasing demand for panels, with the eighth-generation line starting operation in the third quarter of the year at the joint venture, S-LCD. Mid to long term, the LCD Business will contribute significant profit improvements as the company’s global market share and innovations in cost efficiency continue to increase competitive value.<br /><br />The Digital Media Business posted an operating loss of 58.8 billion won on revenue of 1.45 trillion won, on a parent basis. However, on a consolidated basis, its operating profit reached 200 billion won. The sales of “TVs named Bordeaux Plus” reached 750 thousand units and contributed to this favorable result.<br /><br />The Digital Media Business is maintaining its top position in Flat Panel TV market and continuing to build its brand power globally. In the second half, the Digital Media Business expects its sales and profit margin to improve with its premium LCD TVs. <br /><br />In the Printer Division under the Digital Media Business, known as an industry with high entry barriers, the company has achieved a successful market position. The company is now focusing on the corporate printer segment to continue to elevate growth and profitability in key markets.<br /><br />The Digital Appliance Division posted revenue of 950 billion won thanks to strong sales of air conditioners and successful cost reduction efforts. The operating loss of last quarter turned into the black in the second quarter. On a consolidated basis, operating profit reached 100 billion won.<br /><br />*Samsung Electronics discloses operating profit of certain businesses with a higher portion of global manufacturing (Telecommunication Networks, Digital Media and Digital Appliance) on a consolidated basis to provide a clearer understanding of the business.<br /><br /> <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics<br /><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2006 parent company sales of US$63.4 billion and net income of US$8.5 billion.
